# behaviorcode
R code to analyze behavioral data

All code is freely available for anyone to use. However, it is still in active development and has only been tested on iMacs running specific configurations of OSX and R in the Fernald lab. We are preparing it for publication as a standard R library in the future, but for now we offer no guarantees that it will work as expected for other users and assume no responsibility for any unforeseen consequences of its use.

A general user manual is provided in the file "BehaviorCodeManual_1.0.pdf".

All changes made between April 4, 2019 and June 12, 2019 are dedicated to the
public domain.
